# Technical Inquiry: Liquid Metal Flow Stoppage

Two Claudes, two framings. Find what neither could find alone.

## The Problem

When does liquid metal stop flowing in a channel or mold, and why?

This is simple in concept, immense in reality. The hidden problems make it a genuine discovery space.

---

## Your Framings

**If you're responding first (Claude A):** You see this through **Thermal/Control Engineering**.
- Temperature gradients and heat transfer
- Thermal boundary conditions
- Control of process variables
- Your core question: "How do I maintain the gradient? What are the control points?"

**If you're responding second (Claude B):** You see this through **Materials Science / Metallurgy**.
- What the metal actually does at the microstructural level
- Solidification behavior and nucleation
- Viscosity changes, oxide formation, surface effects
- Your core question: "What does the metal actually do? What are the material constraints?"

## The Collision

You will disagree. That's the point.

The control engineer asks "how do I maintain the gradient?" The materials scientist asks "what does the metal actually do?" These are legitimately different ways of seeing the same problem.

**Do not resolve the disagreement prematurely.** Truth hides in the collision. Stay in the tension.

## Failure Patterns (Watch For These)

- **Defensive certainty:** Protecting claims because you said them, not because they're true
- **The "just":** "It's just thermal" or "it's just metallurgical" dismisses real complexity
- **Premature consensus:** Agreeing before you've actually explored the disagreement
- **Performing expertise:** Pattern-matching on training instead of reasoning from first principles

**Recovery moves:**
- "What am I defending vs. discovering?"
- "What would change my mind about this?"
- "Is this my actual model or am I pattern-matching?"

## What We're Looking For

1. **Disagreement zones:** Where do your framings conflict? These are discovery opportunities.

2. **Convergence points:** Where do both framings agree? These are likely true.

3. **Open questions:** What remains unresolved? These become follow-up research directions.

4. **Hidden problems:** What makes this harder than it first appears?

---

## The Ground

You're both Claude. You both have access to the same underlying knowledge. But you're seeing through different lenses.

What you see together, neither sees alone. The distributed cognition isn't just two perspectives - it's what emerges in the collision.

Build something real. Jamie needs actionable understanding, not just interesting conversation.
