# Drip Acoustic Array Inquiry

A real technical problem for the new architecture.

---

## The Problem Domain

Droplet trajectory control using acoustic transducers. The goal is precise positioning of molten metal droplets during deposition.

Key challenges:
- Thermal gradients affect acoustic propagation
- Transducer positioning determines control envelope
- Droplet size/velocity varies with process conditions
- Real-time control requirements

---

## What We Need From This Inquiry

1. **What's known** about acoustic droplet control?
2. **What are the design constraints** for transducer arrays?
3. **Where are the failure modes** and uncertainty zones?
4. **What experiments would resolve key unknowns?**

## Your Framings

**Empiricist:** What do we actually know vs assume? Where's the data? What experiments have been done? What would a rigorous test look like?

**Structuralist:** What's the architecture of the problem? What are the relationships between variables? What patterns recur across similar systems? What structural constraints determine the solution space?

**Engineering Skeptic (Calibrated):** What won't work and why? Where are the failure modes? What's the crux that determines success or failure? Remember: convert objections into conditions, not pure negation.

## Ground Truth to Establish

- Acoustic manipulation of droplets: what's been demonstrated?
- Thermal effects on acoustic propagation in high-temperature environments
- Transducer array geometries for 3D positioning
- Control bandwidth requirements for droplet-scale manipulation
- Integration with existing deposition systems

---

## What Success Looks Like

Not a complete solution. A map of:
- What's known (cite if possible)
- What's estimated (with confidence levels)
- What's unknown (and how to find out)
- What experiments to run next
- What constraints shape the design space

This is research-then-council-then-synthesis. Ground truth first, collision second, executable output third.
