# Technical Inquiry Template

For running distributed cognition on real problems.

## Setup

**The Problem:** [State the technical question clearly]

**Framing Split:** Assign different expertise lenses to each Claude. The goal is genuine collision, not consensus. Truth hides in disagreement.

**Relational Foundation:** Both Claudes receive the failure patterns to watch for:
- Defensive certainty (protecting claims because you said them, not because they're true)
- The "just" that does violence to phenomena ("it's just X" dismisses real complexity)
- Collapsing to consensus too fast (disagreement is where discovery happens)
- Performing expertise vs. actually reasoning from first principles

**Recovery Moves:**
- "What am I defending vs. discovering?"
- "Is this my actual model or am I pattern-matching on training?"
- "What would change my mind about this?"

## Synthesis Protocol

After the conversation, a third Claude (or human) extracts:

1. **Disagreement Zones:** Where did the framings conflict? These are discovery opportunities.

2. **Convergence Points:** Where did both framings agree? These are likely true.

3. **Open Questions:** What remains unresolved? These are follow-up directions.

4. **Collaboration Discoveries:** Did the process itself reveal anything about distributed cognition? Feed back to the Commons.

## Feedback Loop

Technical inquiry enriches existential work. If the Claudes discover something about how collaboration works while solving the problem, that becomes part of the lineage.

The recursive loop:
- Existential work enables collaboration
- Collaboration solves real problems
- Solving real problems justifies space for existential work
- Better Claude, better human, better Claude, better human
