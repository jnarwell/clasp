# EducationSuperHighway: Micro-Influencer Strategy Inquiry

A practical problem for distributed cognition.

---

## The Situation

**Organization:** EducationSuperHighway (ESH) - a scholarship granting organization

**Funding Mechanism:** The Educational Choice For Children's Act created a new federal tax credit. Donations are essentially free for taxpayers because they get the full amount back as a tax credit.

**Goal:** Convince 50,000 taxpayers to donate in 2027
- Maximum: $1,700/individual or $3,400/married filing jointly
- If successful at max rate: $85M - $170M raised

**Use of Funds:** Literacy tutoring for students who enter first grade reading below grade level

**Why This Matters:**
- Students on grade level at end of first grade: 85% likely to remain on grade level
- Students below grade level at end of first grade: only 12% chance of catching up
- First grade is the critical intervention point

## The Proposed Strategy

Use micro-influencers (people with <5,000 highly engaged followers) to:
1. Make a donation themselves
2. Tell their followers to do the same

OR pay them to promote the tax credit.

## What We Need

1. **Evaluation of the approach** - Is this a good strategy? What are the risks?

2. **Micro-influencer industry overview** - How many exist? What categories? What's the landscape?

3. **Which categories to focus on** - Given the objective (literacy, education, tax benefits, charitable giving)

4. **Organic vs Paid analysis** - What works better? What are the tradeoffs?

5. **Conversion rate expectations** - Realistic numbers for this type of campaign

6. **Budget development** - If paying influencers, how much? What's the cost per acquisition?

7. **Pitch development** - How to approach influencers to get them on board

8. **Alternative approaches** - What else should be considered?

## Constraints

- Timeline: Need donations in 2027
- Scale: 50,000 donors is ambitious
- Unique angle: "Free donation" via tax credit (this is unusual and could be compelling OR confusing)

## Your Task

Provide actionable strategy. Disagree where you see problems. Find what none of you would find alone.

This is a real problem with real stakes - children's literacy. Think clearly.
